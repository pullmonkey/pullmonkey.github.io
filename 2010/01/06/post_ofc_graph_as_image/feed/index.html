					<description><![CDATA[Hello,

I would imagine you first run your upload function/s and then reference the image created by those functions in your view.  I&#039;m also looking to go from OFC to PDF and am hoping to find updated instructions (that comply with the JSON format stuff of late) .  Thanks for the lesson.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

I was hoping to do something similar but instead of saving the image to the server I just wanted to generate/view the image. This way I was hoping to use my Prawn PDF generator to just set the image src to a URL and the image would be generated as and when!

Does that make any sense? I find it quite hard to articulate it but I would expect to have something like:

pdf.image foo_path(@foo, :format =&#062; :png)

Temporarily saving the image to the server seems an unnecessary step or am I missing something?]]></description>
