Good morning Alex - thanks for the feedback and concern.  The complete dataset is not rolling out as quickly as we had hoped, mainly b/c of licensing issues around terms of usage and cost.  At this time, I&#039;m not sure of the ETA, I&#039;ll be the first to let everyone know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Your VIN API is exactly what we need. The problem is that we need complete set of data but most VINs still return basic info even if “complete” is set to true. Only small percent of VINs return complete data even for a few years old popular brands such Toyota, Subaru, BMW, GMC etc. Do you have any set target date when every VIN would return complete set of data? Your API works great, your pricing model is great too. It is ideal for us to buy number of decodes and use them over any period of time and not to worry about monthly payments. But we really need the complete data. Please let us know when it will be available for all VINs. Thank you.]]></description>

Hiya Ren -

There isn&#039;t a credit card requirement, just &lt;a href=&quot;http://vinapi.skizmo.com/signup&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sign up&lt;/a&gt; and you&#039;ll get 20 free VIN requests.
Then when you&#039;re ready, purchase a VIN package from &lt;a href=&quot;http://vinapi.skizmo.com/packages_and_pricing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;our pricing page&lt;/a&gt;.
And if you need more trial VIN requests before making a purchase, just let me know and I&#039;ll get you squared away.

And there are no fees, taxes, or anything like that, just the price you see on our pricing page.

- Charlie]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey guys, just got done taking a beating with a competitor who decided we should upgrade even though we were not close to being maxed out, so we decided to &quot;move on.&quot; As I try to absorb all that is written, I guess I&#039;d like to ask, is there a &quot;no charge&quot; trial period we could try to see if it&#039;s a fit for us? If not, it&#039;s ok but, how do we go about starting out on a small scale and then adding/expanding if we think this is a good fit for us?

So far, everything looks and sounds good and it appears that you are trying to offer a needed service without the customer taking a bath trying to utilize it. I can see why it is something that you should charge for, as it is a lot of work but, some of the fee&#039;s that some competitors are getting is nothing short of highway robbery.

Look forward to hearing back as I will continue to wade through all of the info to try and resolve/get started.

Hey Sage - VIN API is still running solid.  Right now, we are still limited on the data we are allowed to provide.  We are working on those issues and will let you know.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Looks like not much discussion on this as of late. I&#039;m wondering if this is still being worked on, and if, eventually, the api will be able to provide more detailed returns -- like base and trim-package features like antilock brakes, sunroof, etc, etc...]]></description>

Oh and btw - I&#039;ve upped your account to the 2000 VINs per month, so you can at least do something while we work out merchant account issues and pricing plans :(]]></description>

We have been bumping people to 2000 VINs per month, since we don&#039;t have a pricing plan.   Legally there is no way to offer &lt;em&gt;unlimited&lt;/em&gt; VIN decodings, unless you want to sign a lot of contracts and pay some non-trivial amount of money.  Sorry about that, but give me a solid estimate of VINs per month and we will work something out.  I&#039;ll tell you this though, our pricing plans will only have soft limits, meaning you will be charged the monthly rate for some number of VINs then charged for any additional VINs (based on whatever plan you pick), so it may work out, such that it seems unlimited :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[We are about to launch a Automotive CRM/ILM software and wanted to know if you would be able to support unlimited vin decode? I know currently you only support 20. Or would you know where I can get past and current vin decoder download where we can upload to our data base?
