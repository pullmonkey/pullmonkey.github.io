Soon after buying it I realized it was approximatly 1\/2 times as fast and 50 times worse. .<\/p>\n<p>I recently installed GTA San Andreas on Vista. Surprisingly (this is sarcasm) it didn&#8217;t work. My mouse would stop working randomly during the game, and when I would go to the in game menu. The game would freeze. This happend regualarly and made it impossible to play. I went to google groups hoping there might be some others who had the same problem. There were, unfortunatly most of the people who answered were apparently retarded telling people to reinstall graphics card drivers and mouse drivers even when the mouse worked fine outside the game.<\/p>\n<p>Frustrated and irritated I went about solving the problem on my own. Thankfully I am such an incredible genius(or maybe just lucky). I figured out how to fix it. My solution is as follows.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing I did to solve the problem was right click the GTA shortcut on my desktop and in the menu click Properties. A Properties window will come up. Click the Compatablity tab. Under Compatablitly mode, check the box that says Run this program in compatability mode for:<br \/>\nThen select Windows 98\/Windows Me from the dropdown list. This is actually a solution I got from the web and I had to do this running the game under XP too.<\/p>\n<p>The game should work fine now if you want to start a new game fresh. However my old game that I started before I got Vista was 95% complete and I didn&#8217;t want to start all over again. Since Vista is confused about its sexuality, it saves the GTA files running under its original compatability in a folder that is in a different location from the one GTA running under compatabilty for Windows 98\/Windows Me. So if you were to start a game in Windows 98\/Windows Me compatabilty all your saved games would not be there. So to combat this, go to the default directory where GTA saves your game in Vista. Mine was C:\\Users\\your username\\Documents\\GTA San Andreas User Files. <\/p>\n<p>SIDE NOTE:<br \/>\nIf you can&#8217;t find this folder, do a search for &#8220;GTASAsf1.b&#8221;. This is the file name GTA uses for your first save slot for your game. Find the directory that contains this file name. This is the directory that contains all your specific user data including defined control settings and your saved games. The folder should be called GTA San Andreas User files. I suppose you could do a search for the directory instead of the game name.<\/p>\n<p>Copy all the files files in that directory. <\/p>\n<p>Now get into GTA start a new game, get to a save point and save it under the first save slot. This will create a saved game in the directory that it saves Windows 98\/Windows XP compatabiilty games under. Now exit the game.<\/p>\n<p>Next go to the new directory where San Andreas saves it&#8217;s files under Windows 98\/Windows Me compatablilty. Mine was C:\\Users\\Public\\Public Documents\\GTA San Andreas User Files, but if you cant find it, do a search for the file name listed above under SIDE NOTE. Just make sure to open the directory that contains the new save file and not the old one. I did this by checking the date the files were modified. Paste all the files from your old Vista compatability directory to this directory and write over all the files. Viola, now when you get into the game all your old saves and controller settings should be there.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>So I bought Vista thinking it was going to be like 10 times faster and 100 times better than XP.
