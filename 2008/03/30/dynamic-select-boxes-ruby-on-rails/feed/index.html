					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your reply Charlie, could you kindly elaborate in clear terms on what changes to make and in which files to do I need to make these changes using your code as guide because I am a rails learner and thus cannot figure out your explanation in the previous post. I will really appreciate if you could start from the controller action or better still  provide us a new tutorial as you opined that clearly explains this concept.

This has been giving me real though time for more than a week now and I will really appreciate your help in this regard and I am pretty sure it will be helpful to lots of people out there too.

Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Foluso - &quot;remote_function&quot; was the old way, this tutorial is over 4 years old :)

Everything has moved away from prototype and to unobtrusive JS with jquery.

So now you would do something like $(&#039;#artist_id&#039;).change(function() { do your jquery ajax call here }); 
Also, you&#039;ll need to change the render :update bits.  Just create a actionname.js.erb file in your views path for the controller.  Then move the code from within the render :update block to the js.erb file, making whatever necessary changes.  

I&#039;ll see about doing a 2012 version of this tutorial.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this tutorial.
I am working on rails 3.2 and I got this error when I navigated to http://localhost:3000/dynamic (dynamic is the name given to the controller)

undefined method `remote_function&#039; for #&#060;#:0xa033f68&#062;

What should I do?]]></description>

Yes, you do need to specify the routes now.  At the time of writing, there was a catch-all mapping for any :controller/:action that was not previously handled.]]></description>
