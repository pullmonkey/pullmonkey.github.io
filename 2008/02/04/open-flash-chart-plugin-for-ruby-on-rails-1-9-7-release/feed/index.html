					<description><![CDATA[Charlie&#060;br/&#062;&#060;br/&#062;This is great stuff. I tried to install your latest changes, but when I use the plugin script I just see the older release (no Line class in open_flash_chart.rb). Will you be committing your changes to SVN soon?&#060;br/&#062;&#060;br/&#062;Thanks,&#060;br/&#062;Scott]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, I&#039;m wondering if it is possible to graph a trend line with missing values. For example, if I want to plot  the value of something every 10 minutes for 6 hours, but a few of the timepoints are missing. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@ilikerice - I think I understand what you are asking, but I am not sure.  You have null values and probably a line graph and you want the line graph to contain null data but not to drop down to 0.  If I understand you correctly you will want to check out this graph - http://pullmonkey.com/projects/open_flash_chart/view_source_code/null_data&#060;br/&#062;You pretty much just put the string &#039;null&#039; for your null data points and the swf object will pick it up.  Note that there are points where data exists and no points where the data is null, but the line continues with the trend.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m confused.  The code in subversion is way different than the code in the 1.9.7 release available on source forge (the 1.9.7 zip file).  This is fine but the code listed here does not appear to work with the plugin code available in the tarball from sourceforge.&#060;br/&#062;&#060;br/&#062;This code does work with the subversion code.&#060;br/&#062;&#060;br/&#062;Also, just a nit...  Can you PLEASE remove all the tabs from the open_flash_chart.rb file ?  Indentation in ruby is by convention supposed to be two normal spaces per indent level.  If you give me commit access I&#039;d be happy to clean it up for you :-)&#060;br/&#062;&#060;br/&#062;Thanks for all your work, this stuff is awesome!&#060;br/&#062;&#060;br/&#062;&#060;br/&#062;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[subaqua - can you give me an example of what is different?  I will gladly fix it.  Also, you have to realize I am a step behind from the zip file release.  I get the zip of 1.9.7 release and then update my code accordingly and update my repository and their sourceforge repository.  That means that the zip you download from sourceforge is my 1.9.6 version.  And yes there is a huge difference there.  If you want to go through sourceforge you will have to get it from trunk, not download.]]></description>
