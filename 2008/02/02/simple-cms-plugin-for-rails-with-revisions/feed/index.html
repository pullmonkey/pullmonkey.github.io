					<description><![CDATA[Cool plugin.

I&#039;m curious about that HTML button you implemented in your Tiny MCE.

I&#039;ve used the ruby version, and i noticed you used straight js for it.

HOW DID YOU GET THAT.  I&#039;ve been looking for 4 hours now, and i can&#039;t seem to figure it out.

you have my email, if you can let me know, you&#039;d be a superstar!!!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Woo hoo, i figured it out man.

I guess i needed to embarrass myself on someone&#039;s blog before my feeble brain caught on.

for those using rails&#039; tinymce plugin, you just need to add code to your list of buttons.

maybe that will help someone.  maybe not.]]></description>
