					<description><![CDATA[I was just stopping in to say hi!

but i feel like i should make a relevant comment so... I like github :-) and git, better than subversion. and i&#039;m using lots of ruby these days :-)

How are you doing? Still at that one place? sometimes i miss that one place but... not that much.... haha

my summer project is going really well and it looks like I&#039;m going to get to continue it through school this year :-)]]></description>
