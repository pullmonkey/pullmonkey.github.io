1) &quot;Page Views&quot; text - not sure what you mean exactly, where is it showing up?  Does the example you are using show it as well?  Is it something that can be taken out in the code?
2) Adding 5 elements to Y Axis breaks Graph - do you have the same number of elements as you do labels?  I&#039;ve had thousands of entries, so we&#039;d have to look at what you have.
3) No tooltip - this might be related to #2 above.  Post a snippet of your code to gist or pastie.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This Example worked as it is intended. However there are couple of things I need to clarify.

In the graph, I am getting the text like &quot;Page Views&quot;.. How to remove this?

And also when I add another 5 elements to the Y.axis, the Graph is broken. How to add as many elements to the Y.axis? Any way that we can manage the Bar width and color? 

And also I am not getting the Tooltip! please help!

					<description><![CDATA[This example wasn&#039;t working for me.  I checked the output of your graph by viewing the returned json with what my version was returning and your copy differed in how the &#034;labels&#034; were output.

I removed the set_labels and labels methods in the plugin and now I get the same results as your example.

Any reason why the label code is needed as it seems to &#034;not work&#034;?

Thanks]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Andrew K. - Hey thanks .. the label code should not be at the open flash chart object level, I think those changes are only needed for XAxis.  I fixed this in the most recent code and committed.  Also, it should not be x.set_labels_from_array, it should have just be x.set_labels.  So the month names should show up now.]]></description>
