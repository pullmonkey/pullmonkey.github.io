					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been using the plugin, and found one problem with it.
I wanted to use js to cause the flash chart to reload data, but in order to do so, I need the id of the flash obj.  There is no way currently to get this that I could find, as the  _ofc method throws a seq # in as  part of the id, so I changed these methods a bit to add a final param to pass in the id.  I did it as an extra param, probably would be more extensible to pass in a hash of options, and have one of them be the id of the flash obj. What do you think, is there a better way to do this?

					<description><![CDATA[@Andrew - I think I see what you are saying.  You want to reload the data that is in the div, where the div has an id like my_chart and some string?  I think a solution would be to give the div a css class, then you can use prototype&#039;s css selector like this $$(&#039;.ofc_chart&#039;) to get all the open flash chart divs on the page and you can reload each one or get the id of each one and go from there.  Thoughts?]]></description>

I think a solution would be to give the div a css class, then you can use prototype&#8217;s css selector like this $$(&#8216;.ofc_chart&#8217;) to get all the open flash chart divs on the page and you can reload each one or get the id of each one and go from there.

					<description><![CDATA[@Scott - There is probably a trick to it, but not anything off the top of my head.  I am using the swf from http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart/, and from what I can tell, it is not supported.  But again, maybe there is a way to rotate the flash after the fact or some other trick?]]></description>
