					<description><![CDATA[Hi there,

I need to put the values at my chart as a static tooltip, directly on the chart without needing a hover action.
Somebody knows how?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Charlie, I copied your example into my controller and created the class ScatterValue:

class ScatterValue &#060; OpenFlashChart
  def initialize(x_value, y_value, dot_size=10)
    @x = x_value
    @y = y_value
    @dot_size = dot_size
  end
end

And it all worked like a peach. Trying to apply the same to a line chart, though, and I can&#039;t seem to get the same results. Any tips on an initialize method for a LineValue class (or something similar?) Thanks for your help.

					<description><![CDATA[@Stuart - oh man! sorry about that, fixed it in my own code to get the scatter graphs working but completely forgot to commit it.  Glad you were able to figure it out :)

I will work out the LineValue stuff tomorrow morning and get back to you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey.. Charlie,

First off, great work on the plugin!

I do have a question regarding the set_num_decimals.  Is there a way that I can use that to set the number of decimals on each bar to 2.  I&#039;m using my bar chart to display money values and can&#039;t figure out how to display with 2 decimals.

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Charlie, thanks for all the cool work!

Just started using openflashchart2 in a Rails 2.0.2 app, but ran into a weird infinite loop when preparing the chart data (page has a couple of your simple Bar chart samples).  Eventually the stack blows:

  stack level too deep
  [RAILS_ROOT]/vendor/plugins/open_flash_chart/lib/open_flash_chart.rb:23:in `to_s&#039;
  [RAILS_ROOT]/vendor/plugins/open_flash_chart/lib/open_flash_chart.rb:23:in `to_json&#039;

      ... hundreds more like this ...

  [RAILS_ROOT]/vendor/plugins/open_flash_chart/lib/open_flash_chart.rb:23:in `to_s&#039;
  [RAILS_ROOT]/vendor/plugins/open_flash_chart/lib/open_flash_chart.rb:23:in `to_json&#039;
  [RAILS_ROOT]/vendor/plugins/open_flash_chart/lib/open_flash_chart.rb:23:in `to_s&#039;
  [RAILS_ROOT]/app/controllers/test_it_controller.rb:37:in `graph_one&#039;


I happened to start using the built-in Ruby 1.8.6 csv library the same day this started cropping up, but that&#039;s about the only coincidental change I can relate this to.

I&#039;m guessing some metaprogramming magic may be involved, but I have no clue how to debug it further.

Thanks for any tips!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@Mark -

Instead of doing render :text =&#062; chart.to_s just do
render :text =&#062; chart.to_json  .. I guess it depends on your environment, never seen this problem before.

@syl - I will take a look and post an example.]]></description>

You mention that I should port it, maybe I missed it.  Where did you see it for OFC II?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@charlie - Exact!! it is not implemented in OFC II... I think that if it was in OFCI it will be enabled in OFCII.

Sorry for that mistake. But do you think, I can ask to OFCII to implement that because I really need it..]]></description>
