					<description><![CDATA[This seems like a very good strat, but it seems as if it would only work if you know your own team personally or if you have ventrilo and you can talk it over before actually fighting. Also i am still a little confused on the giants....are they really that helpful and do they really only require teir 2? i thought it was teir 3, but anyways what happens if they rush the nightelves would there be a way to stop the rush(of course tp and such) but wouldn&#039;t the humans get stuck behind the nightelves and the buildings?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yea this strategy is pretty much for arranged team games. I&#039;ve given up random 3v3 games because even if u are an incredible, it&#039;s still close to a 50-50 chance you will lose and it is extremely frustrating when you get gay people who don&#039;t listen to you and won&#039;t play as a team.&#060;br/&#062;&#060;br/&#062;So the giants...yes giants kick ass! They are IMO the best melee in the game because they can take SOOO much punishment and taunt makes enemies attack them instead of your ranged units. Also they are impossible to polymorph or posses once you get magic resistance. you can start building them at teer two, however it is a good idea to upgrade to teer 3 quickly because hardend skin is insane (it subtracts 12 damage per hit) and magic resistance is also very good. If you buy a staff of preservation and teleport them back to your base when they are hurt you will rarely lose them.&#060;br/&#062;&#060;br/&#062;If the enemy rushes NE, he still should be OK. He has archers or hunts for defense, and his ancients are pretty usefull against melee. However many people attack you, is how many people should be defending. I.E. if 2 enemy players attack you, 2 people on your team should defend. Human is probably best to defend. The NE player should build his base in a way that allows fairly good defense for wisps, but gives some manuverablilty in the base.  I like to build my ancients near the back and put my moonwells near the front so I can get them healing me and my teamate while the enemy attacks. Also if their goal is to kill your tree of life or any ancients they will have to move far into your base and you can trap them inside with your army (when you return via TP or run), and your moon wells.]]></description>
