You get an api key from vinapi.skizmo.com here - &lt;a href=&quot;http://vinapi.skizmo.com/signup&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://vinapi.skizmo.com/signup&lt;/a&gt;. When you sign up, you&#039;ll get an api key good for 20 VIN decodings.  After that, you pick from the packages available here - &lt;a href=&quot;http://vinapi.skizmo.com/packages_and_pricing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://vinapi.skizmo.com/packages_and_pricing&lt;/a&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey,

Not sure what you changed, but thanks!  I ran 5 and they all came back with full datasets, ran 5 more and they all came back good.  I then tried 10 and 100% full datasets.  I logged into my account to see how many remaining credits I had and noticed you bumped it up (thanks for that) so I ran 75 VINs at once and guess what?  That&#039;s right, 100% full datasets!  I&#039;m very pleased and now writing a class to parse the info that I need from it.   Just made my day!  It was pretty quick, too.  I ran each VIN single threaded and it was finished in under 2 minutes.

Regards,
Jacob]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I tried the 10 and 1 came back with a full dataset, 1 was invalid check-sum (guessing the dealer input the vin wrong) and the rest were all short datasets.  

I want to get at least 50% working, that way I can charge dealers per full dataset only and still come out with a little profit.

Now this is weird... I just ran the same 10 VINs again and 6 of 10 (minus one for invalid VIN) came back with a full dataset.   Not sure if you are updating one database with another on the fly or using JOIN but something isn&#039;t working right on your end.]]></description>

Hey Jacob - I credited you with 200 VIN requests.   So please verify and make sure I have the right Jacob :)  You can do the equivalent of VinApi.get(&quot;account_information&quot;) to check.
Strangely enough, those VINs all work for me (again, not saying much).  I&#039;ve added a ton more loggers and we&#039;ll get to the bottom of this.  It has to do with our caching of data sets, for which I&#039;ve fixed a few areas of overlap.
Initially, everything was just the &quot;basic&quot; data set and we have some stubborn VINs in there that we&#039;ve been washing out.
Thanks again for the help.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, 

I tried a few of them and they worked.  I then went to my database and pulled out a small list to check and only the last one I tried worked.  Now, I get the &quot;out of credits&quot; error.  I don&#039;t want to buy credits until I know your service will work for me.  Below is the list of the new list I tried.

					<description><![CDATA[Hey,

Thanks for the quick reply.  I tried the same VIN you have and it was a full dataset, so I know it isn&#039;t my code.  I tried the below VINs from my database, which are current vehicles on the market today from multiple dealerships and all of them returned a short dataset.

1FTRW07L43KD01241
1FMFU17L94LB60432
1FTRW12W65KC97784
JM1NC25F160114359
JTDBT4K38A4067275
3VWRW3AL0AM011110
JA3AJ26E35U053323

Not sure what the issue is but anyway I can help you to resolve it, just let me know.

Regards,
Jacob]]></description>
