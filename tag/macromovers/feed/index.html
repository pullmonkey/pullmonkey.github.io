										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I own a small moving company that does local moves in Albuquerque, NM and the surrounding areas.<br />
We are approaching the end of our first year, and will soon be one year old <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
I run this business on the side with two friends and we have successfully grown it from the ground up.<br />
When we first started it was just the three of us, trying to get a few extra bucks and have some fun.<br />
We started out just doing jobs on the weekend, and over the holidays.<br />
We soon realized how much work it really was and decided that the first order of business would be to hire a couple of guys to do the work for us :).  We hired people rather quickly, all through the paper and craigslist.  Over this year we have hired, fired, and promoted over 40 people in the Albuquerque area, believe it or not, there is a huge turn around rate.  <br />
We have one scheduler, they have been with us since day one, I think the first or second guy we hired.  He is awesome and has brought a lot of success our way.  He handles the customers, the workers, and tracks all of our day to day, he has taken over EVERYTHING, well except for sending out paychecks, we continue to meet and pay our workers every couple weeks, or in some cases when necessary.</p>
<p>If you are looking to move to, from or within Albuquerque, go to <a href="http://macromovers.com">MacroMovers.com</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have spent a few hours throwing together this application to allow emovers to track their moves a little easier.<br />
Everytime an emover logs in, the system collects their latest moves and updates their older moves with any changes in status.  The system tracks all dates, revisions, notes and many other things.<br />
If you are an emover then go ahead and try it out <a href="http://pullmonkey.com/projects/emove_confirmation">here</a>.</p>
<p>Some of my future plans involve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Letting the emover store their password with the system (encrypted) to allow the system to periodically check for new moves.</li>
<li>With every new move that is found the user can receive emails and/or text pages.</li>
<li>Anything else that comes up, let me know.</li>
</ul>
