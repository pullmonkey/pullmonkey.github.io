										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Been playing around with a lot of USB devices lately, to get them to play nicely with some of our touch screen Rails apps.<br />
One of the devices is a card reader - specifically a MagTek reader, and the same code works for the ELO reader.</p>
<p>I've tried a billion different ways to ensure we're reading in all the data.  At first, I was just asking the usb stream to present me with a certain number of characters, b/c that's how all the examples do it.<br />
But we're using a lot of different cards with the readers, so that didn't work too well.  So now I just read one character at a time until we find the new line.<br />
Here's the code to find the device, open it, close it and read from it, all whilst finding and converting the data as required.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/3188668.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script></p>
<p>So using this code, we take the swiped data and send it to our server for storage.</p>

The problem was that the documentation didn't really explain how to do file uploads withing the httpi request block.<br />
Wasn't too much of a big deal, but I thought it may save someone else some time.</p>
