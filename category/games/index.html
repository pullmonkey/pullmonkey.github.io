<h2><a href="../../index.html?p=36" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to A Warcraft III 2v2 Strategy That&#8217;s Effective and Hilariously Fun!">A Warcraft III 2v2 Strategy That&#8217;s Effective and Hilariously Fun!</a></h2><br clear="all" />

<p>The funnest warcraft games I&#8217;ve ever played are usually arranged 2v2 games with me and my friend Jacob. We always have fun devising hilarious and original strategies that always leave us laughing by the end of the game. One such strategy is one I recently came up with involving an all out footmen archer rush with both hero&#8217;s being Tinker.</p>
<p>The first step in this strategy is in the arranged team screen after you choose your partner is THUMBS DOWN (veto) ALL MAPS WITHOUT A TAVERN. We didn&#8217;t bother to do this and we got depantzed (and nearly solomized) 5 times in a row because we kept having to play on maps without taverns. It blew.</p>
<p>The second step is choose your races. We used to go Orc and Night Elf because grunts are pretty kick ass melee, but if they upgraded or built towers we always got owned&#8230;bad. Now we go Human and Night Elf. I like to build footmen and research Defend quickly.  Pesky burrows and gay towers are rendered mostly ineffective.</p>
<p>Now starting off as Human. The first thing you should do is send 4 peasants to your mine and have your fifth start a Barracks. When you build your sixth peasant send him to mine gold (you should have 5 peasants getting gold now) and send all subsequent peasants to harvest lumber. (in total i usually have 6 peasants getting lumber, you will probably end up have excess lumber though). After your seventh peasant returns his first full load of lumber, have him build a farm, then with your eighth peasant build a second farm. When you have enough gold and lumber, build a second Barracks with one of your lumber harvesting peasants. When you get enough gold and lumber after that, build your altar. You should build another farm around this time as well. Build footies at your first Barracks when it is built. When my second Barracks is finished I try to research Defend immediatly there. After that, just pump out footies from both.</p>
<p>Night Elf should send 3 wisps to get gold and the 4th and 5th wisp to make a Moonwell and an Ancient of War. The next two wisps trained should go to your mine, and subsequent wisps to harvest lumber. With the wisp that is building the Moonwell, when he is finished have him harvest a little lumber, probably 5 and then with him, build your Altar. When you get enough gold and lumber build another moon well. A second ancient of war and a third moonwell should be build next when you have the means.</p>
<p>One of the things that is so awesome about buying Tinker is you can build your Barracks (or AOW) first and start pumping out footies (or archers)  and still have your hero almost as fast as someone who built his altar right away. There is no need to send a peasant or a wisp to the tavern to buy your hero, just rally your units there. That way you can be off and rushing without having to wait for your units at your base. ALWAYS REMEMBER TO CHANGE YOUR RALLY POINT to have your units follow your Tinker when you build him. When we forget to do this, we almost always lose. Also be sure to have enough food to buy your Tinker. When we first started doing this we forgot to make a Farm or a Moonwell quickly enough and we&#8217;d end up having to wait a while before we could get our Tinkie. Also HOTKEY YOUR BUILDINGS (if you don&#8217;t already) it&#8217;s makes it soooo much easier to send reinforcements. (Hitting key# and F to build a footman as opposed to going back to your base clicking on Barracks and clicking on footman picture). </p>
<p>It seems like lately a lot of players have been going for a hero rush. If they do this ignore attacking them with your units and go straight for their base. Pocket factory and units do much more damage to them than just one hero will do to you. Of course, if you can, try to micro your peasants/wisps well and protect them. Human can possibly builld an arcane tower early if he has enough gold. NE shouldn&#8217;t build a tower, just try to micro your wisps or rally them to a spot where they aren&#8217;t easily seen. Also some retards attack your entangled gold mine. It is free to repair, just be careful not to let the wisp who is repairing it die. Switch them out if you can. Meanwhile you&#8217;ll be attacking their base with a sizable force of footies who have defend and archers. They will send their hero back to their base if they are smart. If not, just keep killing their base and try to protect your base as well as possible. </p>
<p>The abilities your Tinkers you should get are 1. Pocket Factory and 2. Engineering Upgrade.  Try to lay your pocket factories near their buildings where your units will be. Most opponents will try to kill archers first rather than footmen, try to keep footmen between your enemy and the archers. If they get past, the Night Elf guy might have to run a lot. That is okay though because while your enemies are chasing him, the Human ally has free reign on their base.The order of base attack priority is this. 1. Orc; 2. Human; 3; Undead; 4. Night Elf. Whichever opponent&#8217;s race has the highest priority on this list you should attack first. If you don&#8217;t know or didn&#8217;t scout as a rule we usually go to the opponent closest to your Night Elf&#8217;s base. That way wounded units can be send back and healed faster. We really don&#8217;t upgrade our bases because most of our resources are going into pumping out footies and archers. If they are able to defeat you, you probably will lose, but rather than upgrade, we just try to keep attacking them. </p>
<p>Some things:<br />
For the Human: Turn off defend if you see a hero or unit who is hurt and you have a possibility of surrounding it and killing it, or if your teamates archers are getting flanked by melee (pretty much turn if off if you need to get somewhere quickly). If you&#8217;re trying to surround a unit, use the move command a few times to move your units past it, then when it is in the midst of your units click it with your melee and they will attack it from all sides. If you don&#8217;t kill it and it escapes into it&#8217;s base, you don&#8217;t have to follow it. Just stay near the outside of the base and keep killing buidings. If you teamate is getting flanked. Try to help him. Archers are so unbeleivably weak. Try to get between him and the enemy.</p>
<p>For the Night Elf: Try to focus fire. It helps big time. Intelligence heros are easy to kill, but dont chase after them if they run into their base, just choose a different target. If they have huntresses they should be given high focus fire priority. They take extra damage from peircing attacks.</p>
<p>If they upgrade towers, it&#8217;s not a big deal. Defend (and also more or less archer&#8217;s Elune&#8217;s Grace)  will nearly negate them. You don&#8217;t have to go deep into their base to kill the tower, just let it upgrade and kill the outer buildings or units. </p>
<p>Attack the same base the entire game unitl you kill it. After you kill it, scout the other person. Now you can upgrade your Town Hall or Tree of Life to build units to counter them. We usually are able to kill them right after we killed the first guy though. </p>
<p>If you can, try to avoid attacking a Night Elf base first. Ancients are hookers to kill and they hurt footies a lot. Also, most of the games we&#8217;ve lost were due to a Demon Hunter constantly mana burning us.</p>
<p>Against Orc, we usually go for burrows after we&#8217;ve defeated most of their units, they don&#8217;t do much damage if you have Defend and you can cripple an Orc easily by killing just one or two. Burrows take so long to build and they supply 10 food.</p>
<p>WIth the build order I suggested you probably won&#8217;t be able to buy your Tinker when it is immediatly available, but you WILL have more units. Feel free to deviate from my suggestion depending on what you feel is best.</p>
<p>You might have to try this strategy a few times to get used to it before you get a win. Be patient. Trust me, it works.</p>
<p>I hope you have as much fun as we did using this strategy. We crack up after almost every game when we do this. Be prepared to be called a noob for doing this strat because most people cry when this happens. This is possibly the funniest part. I guess according to their logic, you are a noob if you come up with a winning strategy, . Let me know if you guys consider it a noob strategy. This strat is ESPECIALLY satisfying when you kill someone who tries to hero rush you.  GL! HF!</p>

<h2><a href="../../index.html?p=13" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Best 3v3 Warcraft III Strat Possibly ever invented in the entire universe.">Best 3v3 Warcraft III Strat Possibly ever invented in the entire universe.</a></h2><br clear="all" />

<p>Okay so in my spare time, I enjoy playing one of the coolest games ever Warcraft III. Last year sitting in my physics class pondering new better ways of pwning, I developed this strategy for a 3v3 game.</p>
<p>In 3v3 games I&#8217;ve played, there are three things that most players try to do. They either go for an all out rush,  an all out tech (which in my opinion is a very bad idea), or one person goes all out tech to some powerful unit (chimera, frosty, tauren, something of this sort), while the other two stay on the defensive. </p>
<p>My strategy involves a medium speed tech that is very powerful as you can be teir 2 and still get teir 3 damage, which allows you to attack their base faster and effectivly to stop bundles of wood (fags) who all out tech.</p>
<p>The three races for this strategy are Human, Night Elf, and Undead. </p>
<p>First the human starts off building footmen . One barracks. This works well when people focus fire with dark ranger and archers. In my opinion Defend is one of the dirtiest upgrades in the game because reasearching this one technology allows you to effectively negate any teer one rush with archers or fiends so your team only needs to worry about their melee.</p>
<p>The Night elf starts off building either archers or huntresses depending on the amount of melee the human provides. I think hunts would be best. The NE hero MUST be Priestess of the Moon. Only one ancient of war. Her trueshot will do wonders and a half later on in the game. The night elf should creep with another teamate if he goes archers. He should probably creep with the undead player if the is near. Creeping solo with archers and preistes means she will get her tigers ass handed to her.</p>
<p>The undead builds crypt fiends. The primary hero probably should be Death Knight, but Crypt Lord or Lich can be okay here too. Dread Lord is good also if you decide to later frenzy your Giants. I realize creeping with crypt fiends is semi difficult, but build a tome of relics and buy rod of necromancy to take damage away from Death Knight and fiends.</p>
<p>Moving on. Don&#8217;t rush your upgrade. This makes you vunerable to a rush, so upgrade when you have sufficient gold to while still constantly building units.</p>
<p>The Human techs to mortars. Two workshops. Night Elf goes giants, and one or two Druids of the Claw. I recommend using the &#8220;Move&#8221; command instead of right clicking to patrol in order to have the DOC follow your hero because they ALWAYS die when they rush to the front, or you have to spend precious micromanaging time to keep sending them back. NE player should have two Ancients of Lore. The Undead techs to necros. Two Temples of the Damned. Later if for some reason they have heavy melee before you attack, build Banshees and possess them all. Banshees are one of the best units in the game if you know when and how to use them.</p>
<p>Attack their base when: NE has at least two giants and one bear. Human has 4 or more mortars. Undead has about 4 necros.  (The Undead player should still make fiends if he has the gold.) The beauty of this strategy is you can have so many units attacking the front line at once. You have your giants/few leftover footies or hunts. Fiends (who, by the way, pwn air; net is one of the cheapest upgrades next to defend) attacking farther back, and mortars attacking way far in the back. This allows all units to attack and gives more manuverability within battles because you don&#8217;t have units trying to climb over each other in order to attack.</p>
<p>Now here is the ultimate goal of this strategy. The necros Unholy Frenzy the mortars giving +75% increased attack speed. It is incredible for mortars. Unholy frenzy increases attack speed way more than Bloodlust (eventhough a cloud above a units head is not nearly as intimidating as a bunch of units yelling weirdly). Plus it&#8217;s only a teer 2 spell. DOC should roar near the mortars which adds +25% to attack damage. In addition to this the POTM&#8217;s Trueshot Aura at level 3 adds a whopping 30% to attack damage. So your mortars have a combined 55% attack damage increase in addition to their ultra fast frenzied attack speed. The fiends allow it so even if they have air, they still will recieve the brutal mortar punishment. The giants provide great melee protection. If they try to get past the giants, taunt them. They will not get far.</p>
<p>You can level towns fast! If the enemy is away focus mortar fire on their hall. Ideally you will kill it before one or both of the teamates is able to TP and you will only have one or two teamates to deal with. When they TP, still try to focus mortar fire on their hall. They won&#8217;t be able to repair it fast enough. Then you can focus your attack on the globs of units that just TP&#8217;d. </p>
<p>If you absolutly hate Undead or feel really strongly about Orc, you can substitute shamen for the necros. Witch docs work well with this strategy too because healing wards heal 2% of HP/ sec which is incredible on Mountain Giants. (32hp/sec on every single giant + healing for all your other units = very good 🙂 He should make some sort of AA since you will be naked w/o fiends, raiders w/ ensnare, troll HH, or bats if they don&#8217;t have fiends should work fine.</p>

<h2><a href="../../index.html?p=12" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to How I got GTA San Andreas to Work with (a crappy OS) Vista">How I got GTA San Andreas to Work with (a crappy OS) Vista</a></h2><br clear="all" />

<p>So I bought Vista thinking it was going to be like 10 times faster and 100 times better than XP. Soon after buying it I realized it was approximatly 1/2 times as fast and 50 times worse. .</p>
<p>I recently installed GTA San Andreas on Vista. Surprisingly (this is sarcasm) it didn&#8217;t work. My mouse would stop working randomly during the game, and when I would go to the in game menu. The game would freeze. This happend regualarly and made it impossible to play. I went to google groups hoping there might be some others who had the same problem. There were, unfortunatly most of the people who answered were apparently retarded telling people to reinstall graphics card drivers and mouse drivers even when the mouse worked fine outside the game.</p>
<p>Frustrated and irritated I went about solving the problem on my own. Thankfully I am such an incredible genius(or maybe just lucky). I figured out how to fix it. My solution is as follows.</p>
<p>The first thing I did to solve the problem was right click the GTA shortcut on my desktop and in the menu click Properties. A Properties window will come up. Click the Compatablity tab. Under Compatablitly mode, check the box that says Run this program in compatability mode for:<br />
Then select Windows 98/Windows Me from the dropdown list. This is actually a solution I got from the web and I had to do this running the game under XP too.</p>
<p>The game should work fine now if you want to start a new game fresh. However my old game that I started before I got Vista was 95% complete and I didn&#8217;t want to start all over again. Since Vista is confused about its sexuality, it saves the GTA files running under its original compatability in a folder that is in a different location from the one GTA running under compatabilty for Windows 98/Windows Me. So if you were to start a game in Windows 98/Windows Me compatabilty all your saved games would not be there. So to combat this, go to the default directory where GTA saves your game in Vista. Mine was C:\Users\your username\Documents\GTA San Andreas User Files. </p>
<p>SIDE NOTE:<br />
If you can&#8217;t find this folder, do a search for &#8220;GTASAsf1.b&#8221;. This is the file name GTA uses for your first save slot for your game. Find the directory that contains this file name. This is the directory that contains all your specific user data including defined control settings and your saved games. The folder should be called GTA San Andreas User files. I suppose you could do a search for the directory instead of the game name.</p>
<p>Copy all the files files in that directory. </p>
<p>Now get into GTA start a new game, get to a save point and save it under the first save slot. This will create a saved game in the directory that it saves Windows 98/Windows XP compatabiilty games under. Now exit the game.</p>
<p>Next go to the new directory where San Andreas saves it&#8217;s files under Windows 98/Windows Me compatablilty. Mine was C:\Users\Public\Public Documents\GTA San Andreas User Files, but if you cant find it, do a search for the file name listed above under SIDE NOTE. Just make sure to open the directory that contains the new save file and not the old one. I did this by checking the date the files were modified. Paste all the files from your old Vista compatability directory to this directory and write over all the files. Viola, now when you get into the game all your old saves and controller settings should be there.</p>
