										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over 4 years ago, I wrote <a href="http://pullmonkey.com/2008/03/30/dynamic-select-boxes-ruby-on-rails/">a tutorial for doing dynamic (cascading) select boxes</a>.<br />
Still getting comments and emails to this day.  Mostly asking how to get this working with rails 3, which has moved from prototype to jquery.<br />
So here's a tutorial for getting 3 select boxes to trigger updates for each other.</p>
<p>First set things up:<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3319671.js?file=gistfile1.sh"></script></p>
<p>I just used the html5 haml twitter bootstrap, etc template.  Really useful.</p>
<p>If you need data, here's what I used - put this in your db/seeds.rb file:<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3319679.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script></p>
<p>Next, setup your model associations:<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3319683.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script></p>
<p>Genres have many artists.<br />
Artists have many songs.<br />
Genres have many songs through artists.</p>
<p>I'm just using a home controller to setup variables for the index page as well as setup variables for use in the dynamic updating:<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3319690.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script></p>
<p>Now the view just has the 3 select boxes and the unobtrusive javascript (triggered onchange) to make the ajax calls for updating:<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3319691.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script></p>
<p>We need our rjs files for updating the select boxes, one for the songs (when artist changes) and one for the artists and songs (when genre changes):<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3319706.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script></p>
<p>Our routes are simple:<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3319709.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script></p>
<p>That's it.  </p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  Here's an erb alternative for index.html.<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3366572.js?file=gistfile1.rhtml"></script></p>
<p>And the js.haml can be converted to js.erb by taking #{...} and converting to <%= ... %> :<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/3374533.js?file=gistfile1.rhtml"></script></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking at our data trends for <a href="http://vinapi.skizmo.com">VIN API</a>, we show about 15% of all requests are for the complete data set.  It's the same price as the basic data set and rich with a ton of data.</p>
<p>Check out the data set from <a href="http://pullmonkey.com/2011/01/13/vin-api-phase-ii/">this post over 1 and half years ago</a>.  On top of the basic data set's year, make and model, the complete data set comes with data like MSRP, MPG (city and highway), dealer invoice, gas tank size, etc.   </p>
<p>We get tons of hits for basic data, but at no additional charge we also provide the complete data set.  Just add a complete<br />
=> "true" to your request.   So simple and there's no performance hit. </p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Been playing around with a lot of USB devices lately, to get them to play nicely with some of our touch screen Rails apps.<br />
One of the devices is a card reader - specifically a MagTek reader, and the same code works for the ELO reader.</p>
<p>I've tried a billion different ways to ensure we're reading in all the data.  At first, I was just asking the usb stream to present me with a certain number of characters, b/c that's how all the examples do it.<br />
But we're using a lot of different cards with the readers, so that didn't work too well.  So now I just read one character at a time until we find the new line.<br />
Here's the code to find the device, open it, close it and read from it, all whilst finding and converting the data as required.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/3188668.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script></p>
<p>So using this code, we take the swiped data and send it to our server for storage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever needed to add a header or footer to your spreadsheets in ruby?<br />
Yah, well, we have <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br />
Yes, you can do this with the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/writeexcel">Write Excel gem</a>.<br />
But we've already written years worth of spreadsheet code with the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/spreadsheet">spreadsheet gem</a> and don't want to rewrite it all.</p>
<p>Anyway, we thought we'd share our little trick to get page headers using the spreadsheet gem.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/2502027.js?file=gistfile1.rb"></script></p>
<p>So what you see here (above) goes into a config/initializer, something like RAILS_ROOT/config/initializer/enable_headers_in_spreadsheet_gem.rb.  Here's what's going on:</p>
<p>1) We know that the <em>write_from_scratch</em> method is called when everything is said and done and the data is ready to be written to the spreadsheet file.  So we make use of this and alias that method to <em>write_from_scratch_without_header</em>.  Which opens us up to call our <em>write_header</em> method inside our <em>write_from_scratch</em> method which, of course, will call the original <em>write_from_scratch</em> method.</p>
<p>2) Our <em>write_header</em> method makes use of the already existing opcode for Header in the spreadsheet gem.  It's not being used, so my guess is the developers intend on solving this issue at some point.  We have to send the opcode, the length info and the string we want to write out.  This was the trickiest part to figure out.</p>
<p>3) We expose an add_header method that simply takes a string and stores it in the header accessor.  This means, to set the header, you simply say <em>sheet.add_header("foo header")</em>.</p>
<p>To implement the footer, you'd just do the same thing, create a footer accessor, add a method to update it.  Then build the <em>writer_footer</em> method with <em>opcode(:footer)</em> and append <em>write_footer</em> at the end of <em>write_from_scratch</em>.</p>
<p>Well, that took us some time to figure out, so enjoy and let me know if you have any questions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><code>puts "hello readers" <span style="color:#8b8">if you_are_a_reader</span> <span style="color:#88b">if you_can_read</span> <span style="color:#b88">unless you_already_read_it</span></code></p>
<p>I was playing around with some <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">project euler</a> code I'm working on (anyone else figure out the Pencils of Rays with code that executes in less than a minute??). Anyway - I was going through my code and adding "if debug" to the end of all my puts statements b/c I didn't want to see them for the next run through. So by mistake, I blindly added "if debug" at the end of 'puts "odd" if odd', giving me 'puts "odd" if odd if debug'.  Neat.  Then, going through trying to find the bottlenecks, I noticed it. So jumped into irb to make sure it was legit and it was.</p>
<p>Interesting.  Not sure where I'd ever use it, though.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you install the Android SDK / JDK, etc?  If not, start here - <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html</a>.<br />
If you're running 64-bit like me, make sure to install the ia32-libs, since the SDK is 32-bit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is completely based on <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/hello-world.html">the Hello Android tutorial</a> - I didn't really do a whole lot, but the hope is that this will help get some more ruby devs into android development with a simple how-to.<br />
</p>
<h3>Step 1 - Setup RVM with jruby</h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> RVM is awesome, if you don't use it or don't know about it - read more <a href="http://beginrescueend.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<pre style="border:1px dashed black; padding: 4px; background-color: #ddd;">rvm install jruby
cd /path/to/your/android/pindah/mirah/project/dir/
# using your .rvmrc will trigger `rvm use jruby` when you cd into your project dir.
echo "rvm use jruby" &gt; .rvmrc
# this will make sure your .rvmrc is working, you should then be able 
# to use rvm info and see jruby
cd .</pre>
<p></p>
<h3>Step 2 - Install the mirah and pindah gems</h3>
<p></p>
<pre style="border:1px dashed black; padding: 4px; background-color: #ddd;"># too easy
gem install mirah pindah</pre>
<p></p>
<h3>Step 3 - Create your first pindah app</h3>
<p></p>
<pre style="border:1px dashed black; padding: 4px; background-color: #ddd;">pindah create com.example.android.hello_world
cd hello_world</pre>
<p></p>
<h3>Step 4 - Create your activity - HelloAndroid.mirah</h3>
<p></p>
<pre style="border:1px dashed black; padding: 4px; background-color: #ddd;"># from your project dir and inside your pindah app dir 
&lt;editor&gt; src/com/example/android/hello_world/HelloWorld.mirah</pre>
<p>This is the code I used:<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1361596.js"> </script></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Step 5 - Setup your AndroidManifest.xml file</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This is where you define your app, version, name, etc, but more importantly for this example - what activity will handle your main intent.<br />
Mine looks like this:<br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1361597.js"> </script></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Step 6 - Install to your device</h3>
<p></p>
<pre style="border:1px dashed black; padding: 4px; background-color: #ddd;"># make sure a device is recognized  ... 
# and make sure adb is in your path (platform-tools in the SDK)
adb devices
rake install</pre>
<p></p>

<h3><strong>To get started, you'll need jruby and the mirah gem:</strong></h3>
<pre style="border:1px dashed black; padding: 4px; background-color: #ddd;">rvm install jruby
rvm use jruby (or put in your .rvmrc)
gem install mirah</pre>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Then create an example:</strong></h3>
<pre style="border:1px dashed black; padding: 4px; background-color: #ddd;">puts "hello world!!"
500.times do |x|
  puts x
end</pre>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Time in ruby:</strong></h3>
<pre style="border:1px dashed black; padding: 4px; background-color: #ddd;">time ruby test.mirah</pre>
<p>...<br />
=&gt; .457s</p>
<h3><strong>Compile to Java and time:</strong></h3>
<pre style="border:1px dashed black; padding: 4px; background-color: #ddd;">mirahc test.mirah
time java Test</pre>
<p>....<br />
=&gt; .081s</p>
<h3><strong>Less than 1/5 the time and it compiles to Java ... neat <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></h3>
<pre style="border:1px dashed black; padding: 4px; background-color: #ddd;">mirahc -j test.mirah

// Generated from test.mirah
public class Test extends java.lang.Object {
  public static void main(java.lang.String[] argv) {
    int __xform_tmp_1 = 0;
    int __xform_tmp_2 = 0;
    int x = 0;
    java.io.PrintStream temp$1 = java.lang.System.out;
    temp$1.println("hello world");
    __xform_tmp_1 = 0;
    __xform_tmp_2 = 500;
    label2:
    while ((__xform_tmp_1 &lt; __xform_tmp_2)) {
      x = __xform_tmp_1;
      label3:
       {
        java.io.PrintStream temp$4 = java.lang.System.out;
        temp$4.println(x);
      }
      __xform_tmp_1 = (__xform_tmp_1 + 1);
    }
  }
}</pre>
