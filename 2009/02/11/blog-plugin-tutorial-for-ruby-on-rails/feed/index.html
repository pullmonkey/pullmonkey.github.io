					<description><![CDATA[Hi,

Great tutorial. First one which actually worked for me. Was Googling the whole web for a decent tutorial to learn to build a rails engine. Went through few other tutorials for this but got struck or got some unknown error when following them. This is the first one which went off quite well.

Thanks a lot.

Could you provide the second part of the tutorial. Really need them. Please... :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s great for people to have options on how to get their blog rolling -- it definitely shouldn&#039;t be a hard thing for people to do.

That said, the record should indicate that Bloggity does not require the Engines plugin to run if you are using Rails 2.3 or above (where the Engines plugin is baked in).   Please update accordingly.

Thanks,
Bill]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cool stuff Charlie.  Plugins are still new to me. :)

In your init.rb file, where does &#039;directory&#039; come from in model_path = File.join(directory, &#039;app&#039;, &#039;models&#039;)?  Is that a helper method Rails provides?  I assume &#039;config&#039; is a helper method also?

Don&#039;t you need to migrate your database with the migrations you created before you do the testing you describe?

					<description><![CDATA[@Bryan - directory is a variable for the current directory of the file you are running the File.join method from.  It is a ruby method from File.

Yes, must run migrations - thanks for pointing that out - updated the article :)]]></description>
