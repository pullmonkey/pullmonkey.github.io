					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;http://pullmonkey.com/2009/09/19/getting-pretty-serious-now/comment-page-1/#comment-1283&quot;&gt;MichaelT&lt;/a&gt;.

I got my headlight/taillight form fat tire cycles on montono.  Working pretty well, they are more for others to see me than they are for improving visibility.

And, I&#039;ve been reading tons about cadence, either being a spinner or a masher, like Armstrong or Ulrich.  I have tried both so far.  For Monday&#039;s trip home, I used a low cadence of 60 rpm and it took me 10 percent longer than Tuesday&#039;s ride where I increased my cadence to an average of 90 rpm.  It is interesting that increasing my cadence by 50% only improved my time by 10%, except I wasn&#039;t as worn out at the end.  What I noticed was that my legs weren&#039;t as tired and I was able to get up those hills more easily.  It definitely seems worth messing with cadence to find the right fit, so I am going to try a few more things.  I have a mountain bike so my highest gear is pretty low and I end up pedaling a lot anyway :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been debating whether I want a cyclocomputer. I used to use one, and I ended up competing with myself. That&#039;s okay, but I&#039;m trying to slow down my top speed and increase my cadence speed. The thinking is that when I get really going in the top speeds I am really not pedaling all that much, so increasing the cadence will keep my heart rate higher.

Do you have a headlight/taillight recommendation?]]></description>
