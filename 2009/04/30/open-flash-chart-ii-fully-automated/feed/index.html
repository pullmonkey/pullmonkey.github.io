					<description><![CDATA[Awesome plugin, however, one think I&#039;m failing to see is how I&#039;d make a graph like the one shown here; http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart-2/x-axis-date.php . Since there isnt much of an API I find it hard to figure out how to build it - could someone perhaps enlighten me here?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Charlie,

Yes, I was having a problem with installing the OFC II plugin, but I finally managed to get it to work with this:

ruby script/plugin install http://github.com/pullmonkey/open_flash_chart.git/

...with the trailing slash after .git because apparently you need that while installing a plugin on a Windows machine.

Sorry about commenting on the wrong page. I had this page open in another tab and so ended up leaving the comment here, which probably caused you the confusion about what URLs I was talking about. And thanks again for the great plugin. :)]]></description>

Hey Nithin,

Which urls are you trying?  I did a quick check of all the clickable links on the page, they all seem to be fine.  Are you having problems with a plugin/install?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, thanks for creating this great plugin. I&#039;ve tried using the older version of this plugin and it worked great. But when I try installing OFC II, I get a &quot;plugin not found&quot; message for either of the URLs that you&#039;ve given.

Am I doing something wrong there? I used the same procedure for installing the older version and that worked fine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Charlie, thanks for a very useful plugin.  After some messing around I decided I wanted to leverage the &#039;get-data&#039; model of OFC (not just &#039;data-file&#039;).  This lets me embed the json data in the html output and avoid another request cycle for ofc to fetch the data.  Not needed in all situations, but handy in many.  My git-patching-fu isn&#039;t great so the very simple addition of one method to open_flash_chart_object.rb OpenFlashChart::Controller is here for anyone interested:

&#060;filter:code attributes=lang=&#034;ruby&#034;&#062;
    def open_flash_chart_embedded(width, height, div_name, json_data, use_swfobject=true, base=&#034;/&#034;, swf_file_name=&#034;open-flash-chart.swf&#034;)
      &#060;&#060;-HTML
      &#060;div id=&#034;#{div_name}&#034;&#062;&#060;/div&#062;
      &#060;script type=&#034;text/javascript&#034;&#062;
        swfobject.embedSWF(&#034;#{base}#{swf_file_name}&#034;, &#034;#{div_name}&#034;, &#034;#{width}&#034;, &#034;#{height}&#034;, &#034;9.0.0&#034;, &#034;expressInstall.swf&#034;,
                          {&#034;get-data&#034;:&#034;chartData#{div_name}&#034;});

        function chartData#{div_name}() {
          return &#034;#{json_data.gsub(&#039;&#034;&#039;,&#039;\&#034;&#039;)}&#034;;
        }
      &#060;/script&#062;
      HTML
    end
&#060;/filter:code&#062;

Note this method requires you provide a div_name but it would be trivial to hook it up to the existing div_name generator.

Cheers, --Kip]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hey, first off, incredible work on this plugin. I have used it for numerous projects, and I absolutely love it. I cant thank you enough for your tireless work on this project...

I have a question that Id normally email you to ask, but I can&#039;t find your email, so I&#039;m settling for a comment.

I have graphs that occasionally have no data in them, so what Id like to do is display a &#034;NO DATA AVAILABLE&#034; message in the same style as the &#034;LOADING&#034; bubble that appears when the graph first loads....is there any way to achieve this? I&#039;ve been searching high and low for a way to figure it out. Right now, it just display a blank space when no data is available, but Id really like to display a message to the user instead of just a white box.

Again, thanks for your hard work.
Best,
Rob]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi, Charlie , with test branch plugin installed, I can successfully make my line chart. But there is still an issue that is I CANNOT make the X Axis Labels display?
